# 🌐 i18n Guidelines

Welcome to our i18n Guidelines! We appreciate your interest in translating our courses.

## Community Translations

At the moment, we are unable to offer translation maintenance.

However, we know some contributors are willing to translate and help our courses to reach a broader audience. We value these contributions! ✨

Please keep reading if you want to translate the Open Source Education Path with OpenSauced.

## Why Translating Our Courses

Here are some benefits of translating our courses:

- You will have the opportunity to learn to maintain a project and **become the maintainer** of the translation as it will live in your forked repository.
- You can learn and experience collaborating with contributors, nurturing the translation community, and even assembling your own maintainers' team!
- You will be able to learn how to deploy and host a static website on your own.
- You can make the translation available as soon as possible for a broader audience.
- You can update the translation faster by reviewing and merging in pull requests yourself as a maintainer.

> [!TIP]
> It will be helpful taking our [Becoming a Maintainer](../docs/becoming-a-maintainer/README.md) course to equip you in maintaining your forked repository.
