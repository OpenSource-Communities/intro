# Types of Contributions

In this chapter, we will discuss the non-coding and coding types of contributions involved with open source projects.

## Non-Coding Type of Contributions

Non-coding contributions are types of contributions that do not involve writing or modifying code. However, they are essential for the sustainability and growth of open source projects.

These types of contributions allow individuals with various skills and backgrounds to participate and make meaningful contributions to the software and the community. You can read [this article](https://dev.to/opensauced/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-without-knowing-how-to-code-a-guide-with-project-suggestions-59e5) to learn more about contributing to open source projects without knowing how to code.

Next, we will talk about some common non-coding contributions.

### Documentation

Are you a lover of words? Do grammar errors irritate you? Do you like breaking down complex problems or helping people learn? Then, documentation is for you!

Documentation is crucial to open source projects. It involves creating, improving, or maintaining the written resources accompanying open source software projects. Documentation can make a project more accessible and user-friendly, help attract new users, and encourage repeat contributions to the project.

#### Tips for Contributing to Documentation

If you are interested in contributing to documentation, here are a few tips that you might find helpful:

- **Read the entire documentation**. This will help you better understand how the product is used.
- **Find a task that fits your skills and interests**. If you're unsure where to start, look at the issues or discussions you believe you can tackle before reaching out to a maintainer.
- **Use the product**. Gaining user insight will help you determine which information needs to be added to or removed from the documentation.
- **Be patient and persistent**. Writing good documentation takes time. Don't be afraid to ask for help if you get stuck.

#### Examples of Documentation Contributions

Now, you might wonder what you should do to contribute to a project's documentation. Here are some examples of what to contribute:

- **Write or update the README file**. If you see that a project needs a README explaining how to install and use it, you can offer to write one. Or, if you notice information or instructions are missing from the README, you can create an issue and suggest how to update it.

- **Create a tutorial**. When the documentation about a feature is unavailable, you can address this and create a tutorial that guides users through the feature.

- **Update the project's documentation**. Sometimes, a project has new changes or launches, but the maintainers still need to update the documentation. You can help update the documentation to reflect these new changes.

- **Translations**. If you're bilingual, you can contribute to a project by translating the documentation into other languages to reach broader users.

- **Fix typos and grammatical errors**. Although they seem small, fixing typos and grammatical errors can help maintain consistency and clarify the documentation.

### Graphic Design

This open source contribution involves creating visual assets, such as logos, icons, illustrations, website designs, and other graphical elements, for open source projects. These visual assets play a significant role in enhancing the overall user experience and branding of the project. Graphic design contributions can make open source software more appealing, user-friendly, and recognizable.

- **Logo and Branding**: Designing a unique and memorable logo for an open source project can help establish its identity and brand. A well-designed logo can make the project instantly recognizable and give it a professional image.

- **Icon Design**: Icons are essential for user interfaces. Graphic designers can create custom icons for software applications or websites, improving the visual appeal and usability of the project: [Eventhub signup](https://github.com/WebXGuild/webx-guild/pull/13)

- **Website Design**: Open source projects often have websites to provide information, documentation, and download links. Graphic designers can contribute by designing website layouts, graphics, banners, and other visual elements to make the site more attractive and user-friendly.

- **User Interface (UI) Design**: For software projects, UI design is crucial. Designers can create mockups, wireframes, and high-fidelity designs for the user interface, making it more intuitive and visually appealing.

- **User Experience (UX) Design**: UX designers focus on improving the overall user experience by considering how users interact with the software. This includes designing user flows, navigation, and usability testing.

- **Accessibility Design**: Ensuring that the project's graphical elements are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, is an important aspect of graphic design. Designers can create accessible color schemes and ensure that visual elements are perceivable and operable.

- **Responsive Design**: Designing visuals that work well on various devices and screen sizes is crucial for modern web applications. Responsive design ensures that the project looks good and functions properly on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Blog Writing

This type of open source contribution involves creating and publishing blog posts, articles, or tutorials related to open source software, projects, technologies, or best practices. Like documentation, you don't necessarily have to know how to code to write these posts.

#### Ways to Use Blogging as an Open Source Contribution

## Coding Type of Contributions

Coding contributions power open source development. They entail writing, modifying, or improving the actual source code of an open source project, directly impacting the functionality and quality of the software. Contributors collaborate with project maintainers and the community to ensure that their code contributions align with project goals and coding standards. Also, open source projects typically have guidelines and processes for accepting and integrating coding contributions, such as code reviews and continuous integration.

Here are some examples of contributions you can make to a project with your coding skills:

- **Writing New Code**: This is the most common type of coding contribution. Developers write new code to add features, fix bugs, or enhance the functionality of an open source project. These contributions are typically submitted in the form of pull requests (PRs) or patches: [Show who reacted to highlights](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/pull/1591)

- **Bug Fixes**: Identifying and fixing bugs is a critical coding contribution. Developers locate issues within the codebase, diagnose the problem, and then write code to correct it. Bug fixes improve the stability and reliability of the software: [Lint check happening two times on commit
