## Expectations

This course is designed to provide you with a solid foundation in open source collaboration. While we‚Äôll cover a range of topics and provide examples, demos, and opportunities for hands-on practice, it‚Äôs essential to have realistic expectations about what you can achieve during the course.

1. **Practice is crucial**: Learning about open source is just the beginning. To truly develop your skills and become a proficient contributor, practice consistently. The more you contribute to open source projects, the more you‚Äôll learn and grow as a developer.

2. **Patience is key**: Becoming proficient in open source collaboration takes time and effort. Don‚Äôt be discouraged by challenges; remember that every contribution, no matter how small, is valuable and helps improve the project.

3. **Engagement with the community**: Open source is more than just code; it‚Äôs about the people who collaborate and contribute to projects. Engage with the community by asking questions, sharing knowledge, and supporting others. Building relationships with other contributors will enhance your open source experience and help you grow as a developer.

4. **Continuous learning**: Open source is a rapidly evolving field, with new projects, tools, and technologies emerging all the time. Stay curious and open to learning. Use resources like documentation, tutorials, and community forums to expand your knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest developments.

5. **Developing a growth mindset**: Embrace the challenges and opportunities that come with open source collaboration. Adopt a growth mindset focused on learning, improvement, and resilience.
