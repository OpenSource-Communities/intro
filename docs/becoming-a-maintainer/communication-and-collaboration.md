Effective communication and collaboration with contributors are the keys to a thriving open source community. As maintainers, you want to smoothly onboard new contributors to your projects and build a welcoming community with open lines of communication between contributors and maintainers.

This chapter will discuss how to onboard new contributors, utilize different communication channels for your open source project's community, and maintain healthy communication.

## Project Onboarding

Onboarding new contributors to your project is essential to maintaining its health and growth. This becomes possible through establishing effective communication, starting with your project's documentation.

Providing clear information and directions about the project's goals, processes, and codebase is key to helping new contributors collaborate. Effective communication allows you to attract contributors to return, learn more about your projects, and continue contributing. In doing so, you create a sustainable ecosystem where knowledge is shared, responsibilities are distributed, and the project can continue to evolve and grow.

There are several ways to establish effective communication in your project to achieve good collaboration.

### Clear Documentation

Easy-to-understand and well-organized documentation ensures a good onboarding experience for new contributors. Clear documentation saves time, prevents errors, and promotes transparency and accountability, which are vital for effective communication. It is best to invest time and effort in creating clear documentation for your project.

Consider the following when writing or updating your documentation:

- **Simple language and universal examples**  
  Ensure that your documentation is easy to understand for most contributors — including non-native English speakers.

- **Clear guides**  
  Whether it's the setup guide in the README, instructions to run and use the project, or contributing guidelines, always provide clear directions for contributors to follow for better collaboration.

- **Dedicated place for documentation**  
  If your README is becoming too long, consider creating a new file or repository dedicated to your project's documentation. This ensures a logical flow and improves communication about your project.

### Issue Labels

Labeling issues is an excellent way to categorize and communicate their status in your project. It can also help create paths for contributors. The "[How to Handle Open Issues and Pull Requests](issues-and-pull-requests.md)" chapter covers this topic in more depth.

The `good first issue` label is perfect for beginner-friendly issues. Think of contributors who are new to the tech stack or to open source in general. It can be a good starting point for them to contribute to your project. Consider pointing to the relevant code blocks and providing step-by-step instructions for working on the solution.

If an issue is complex and must be fixed promptly, you can add labels like `core team work`, `critical`, or others based on your project's conventions to prevent frustration and confusion.

### Issues and Pull Request Templates

Having issue and pull request templates in your project makes it easier for you to triage and review submissions. They also help contributors understand how to approach the project and what details to include when creating one.

## Regular Communication

It is recommended that you provide spaces outside your project where contributors can ask questions, request guidance, and share ideas. This allows them to communicate and collaborate actively with other collaborators and maintainers.

Here are some channels you can consider for regular communication:

### Chat Service Apps

It’s best to provide a chat service app to accommodate both asynchronous and synchronous communication for your community. With this, contributors can ask questions, connect, and collaborate in near real-time. It also supports communication across time zones. A chat app benefits maintainers by allowing quick project announcements, calls for help, synchronous office hours, and more.

Tech communities widely use the following apps. Choose based on your preference and your community’s needs.

#### Discord Community

> [Discord](https://discord.com/) is a voice, video, and text communication service used by over a hundred million people to connect with friends and communities.

Discord is a good choice if your community relies heavily on group voice and video calls. Creating a channel for calls makes it easy for members to join and chat instantly. Discord is also suitable for building larger communities because public servers can be searched and joined by anyone with a Discord account.

#### Slack Group

> [Slack](https://slack.com/) is the productivity platform that empowers everyone with no-code automation and AI, makes search and knowledge sharing seamless, and keeps teams connected and engaged.

Slack primarily targets businesses and professional teams. If your community prioritizes text chat over voice or video, Slack is an excellent option with its simple interface and ability to organize conversations. Slack also integrates with thousands of business applications, including Zoom and GitHub.

### GitHub Discussions

[Discussions](https://github.com/features/discussions) is a collaborative communication forum for the community around an open source project. It allows users to ask questions, share ideas, and build connections.

You can enable discussions in your project by following [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/quickstart#enabling-github-discussions-on-your-repository).

### Community Forum

A community forum is another valuable communication space where members can connect, engage, and discuss project-related topics.

One benefit of a forum is that it provides a searchable archive of questions and answers. Contributors encountering recurring issues can often resolve them by searching the forum, saving maintainers time. Since forums are public and searchable by search engines, they can also help attract new users and contributors.

You can create a forum as a subdomain of your website or as a standalone site. A great example is the [freeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/).

## Effective Communication

Effective communication is key to project success. It resolves issues, builds trust and transparency, and encourages collaboration. By fostering open and healthy communication, you can ensure everyone is on the same page and working towards a common goal.

### Engaging with Contributors

A maintainer’s goal is to encourage contributors to return and continue contributing. To nurture this relationship, make time to engage with your contributors outside of task management.

Start by acknowledging and thanking them for issues or pull requests. Ask questions if something is unclear and avoid assumptions.

In an international remote environment, assumptions often cause misunderstandings. Writing is different from speaking, and contributors from diverse cultural and language backgrounds may struggle to express their intentions or understand idioms. Use clear and explicit language, keep messages concise, and use bullet points or multiple comments for clarity.

Live streams are another way to engage contributors. At OpenSauced, we host monthly live streams to thank contributors, highlight pull requests, and show appreciation. You could also stream issue work sessions and invite the community to participate.

Remember, maintainers are human. If you’re upset or tired, it’s okay to take time before responding. A delayed but thoughtful reply is always better than a hasty, harsh one.

### Managing Expectations

Setting expectations early ensures smoother collaboration. Communicate what contributors can expect from you, and what you expect from them.

#### Small Issues

Most open source contributors are volunteers. They contribute in their spare time and cannot be expected to work with the speed of full-time employees. Break large issues into smaller, more manageable ones to make contributions easier and faster.

#### Style Guide

Each project has its own conventions. You might require specific prefixes in issue and pull request titles, e.g., "[Bug]: Documentation link goes to 404 Page Not Found," or enforce [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). You may also prefer specific Markdown styling rules.

Don’t assume contributors know these rules. Provide a clear style guide, such as GitHub’s [Style Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/style-guide-and-content-model/style-guide).

#### Support

Consider what support you can provide:

- **Space**: Where can contributors ask questions and share ideas?  
- **Pair programming**: Can you provide extra guidance for beginners?  
- **Office hours**: Scheduled office hours are a great way to listen to ideas, resolve issues, and build stronger relationships.

Adding a section in your README or contributing guide about available support and how to access it builds trust and motivation.

#### Timeline

Communicate how quickly contributors can expect feedback on pull requests or questions. For example, inform them if you’re unavailable on weekends. You can even automate these messages using GitHub Actions (see the "[Maintainer Power Ups](maintainer-powerups.md)" chapter).

#### Boundaries

As your project grows, setting boundaries is crucial to prevent burnout.  

Examples include:  

- **Taking breaks**  
  Let contributors know when you’ll be away and when they can expect a response.  

- **No private messages**  
  Request that contributors avoid private or direct messages about the project. Keep discussions public for transparency, inclusivity, and privacy.

### Handling Difficult Situations

Eventually, you may face conflicts in your community. While these are never easy, preparation helps.

#### Active Listening

You can’t resolve a problem without fully understanding it. Active listening means hearing, understanding, and acknowledging the speaker’s words and feelings.  

Key techniques:  

- Be fully present (don’t plan your response while they talk).  
- Show interest (e.g., eye contact in synchronous talks, paraphrasing in chat).  
- Acknowledge emotions (“I see this upset you” / “I’m excited for you!”).  
- Ask clarifying questions (“You said they contacted you Monday — did they file the complaint the same day?”).  

#### Empathy and Compassion

Approach disputes with empathy and compassion. Listen to both sides without judgment, put yourself in their shoes, and aim to resolve conflicts constructively.

#### Tact and Diplomacy

Address problems with respect and sensitivity. Choose words carefully, balancing truth with kindness.  

**Example:**  

Instead of:  
> "Why do you always deliver code that doesn’t align with what we want? Do you even test your code?"  

Try:  
> "Thank you for your quick work, {username}. I really appreciate it! To improve quality, here are a few suggestions:  
> - Take time to fully understand the issue before starting. If unclear, feel free to ask for clarification.  
> - Run and test the code locally before submitting PRs to ensure it works as expected.  
>   
> I hope this feedback is helpful. Let me know how I can support you."  

In the [next chapter](maintaining-code-quality.md), we will discuss maintaining code quality and documentation.
