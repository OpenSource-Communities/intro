Open source is more than just maintaining and improving a project. It's a dynamic environment where maintainers, contributors, and users come together to collaborate, contribute, and grow. Importantly, the people involved in the project are the core and heart of open source.

As more people engage and contribute to your projects, it becomes crucial to provide them with the necessary support and motivation to establish a welcoming and positive community environment. Doing so builds stronger relationships and fosters a sense of belonging among your members, keeping them engaged and dedicated.

In this chapter, you will learn how to build and nurture a welcoming and supportive open source community.

## Positive Community Culture

Community members engage in different ways. Some are highly active, some participate occasionally, and others simply observe. But one thing is certain: everyone shares a common interest in your project, and they all bring value. You should ensure that everyone feels welcome, included, and—most importantly—safe in your community. A key to achieving this is fostering a positive community culture.

### Open Communication

Successful open source communities encourage open communication. This helps everyone understand what’s happening around the project, builds trust, and promotes healthy collaboration. Members should feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas while also being able to listen and respond respectfully to others.  
For tips about communication and collaboration, read the chapter "[How to Communicate and Collaborate Effectively](communication-and-collaboration.md)."

### Diversity and Inclusivity

Creating a safe and welcoming environment requires prioritizing inclusion and promoting diversity. Inclusion means treating everyone with respect, regardless of background, beliefs, or opinions. By fostering a culture where people are encouraged to be authentic while also appreciating others, you create a space where everyone feels respected and valued. Building a community where everyone feels they belong is essential.

### Code of Conduct

Every project should have a code of conduct that clearly defines how members of the community should behave and interact. For example, you can emphasize the importance of using positive and inclusive language, treating others with respect, and avoiding discrimination or harassment. You should also explain the consequences for not following these guidelines.  
A code of conduct prevents conflicts, promotes respect, and ensures that everyone feels safe and comfortable. You can read the "[Code of Conduct](how-to-setup-your-project.md#code-of-conduct)" section in the "How to Setup Your Open Source Project" chapter to learn how to create one.

### Addressing Conflicts

Conflicts may arise in any community. Imagine seeing a member behave disrespectfully on GitHub or Discord, or receiving a report of harassment. Unfortunately, most open source communities will face these situations at some point. Being prepared to address them helps maintain a positive culture.  
You can learn more about managing conflicts in the "[Handling Difficult Situations](communication-and-collaboration.md#handling-difficult-situations)" section of the "How to Communicate and Collaborate Effectively" chapter.

### Leading by Example

Leadership is not about being in charge—it’s about taking responsibility and modeling the behavior you want to see. Demonstrating respect, listening actively, and staying open to learning will encourage others to follow your lead.

### Recognition and Appreciation

Recognition is the key to unlocking the full potential of an open source community. Expressing gratitude toward your team and contributors is fundamental to creating a supportive culture.

Contributions come in many forms. Take time to recognize these efforts—through awards, public shoutouts, or simply acknowledging their work. One way to do this is by installing the [All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org/) bot to automate adding contributors to your project.

At OpenSauced, we recognize that [contributions aren’t just green squares](https://opensauced.pizza/blog/moneyball-for-engineers). We value all kinds of contributions that help our projects and community thrive. In addition to using the All Contributors bot in our [guestbook repository](https://github.com/open-sauced/guestbook), we highlight contributors through monthly live streams, blog posts, newsletters, and social media.

Recognizing and appreciating contributions creates a ripple effect, inspiring others to do the same and strengthening positivity across the community.

## Creating Opportunities for Contributions

In open source, people want to make meaningful contributions and feel part of the community. To attract returning contributors, you need to provide spaces and opportunities that encourage them to stay engaged.  

### Identifying Contributor Levels

To create opportunities, you should first identify contributors' entry points.

#### New Contributors

These are individuals new to open source or to your project. They often need guidance and support, so it’s important to provide clear documentation and resources about how your project works, including Git and GitHub basics.

#### Intermediate Contributors

Intermediate contributors have some experience and want to deepen their involvement. They usually require less guidance and can navigate your project through documentation. At this stage, they may also seek opportunities to grow their skills and take on greater responsibility, possibly even becoming maintainers.

#### Expert Contributors

These are seasoned contributors who can provide high-level contributions and leadership. They often generate new ideas and improvements because they actively use and value your project. When they encounter bugs, they are motivated to fix them quickly to continue benefiting from your work.

### Encouraging Diverse Contributions

A thriving community welcomes contributions of all kinds, not just code. By encouraging coding and non-coding contributions, you allow people to bring their unique skills and perspectives. However, you should also consider the level of support you can provide.

#### Code Contributions

After identifying contributor levels, create issues tailored for different skills.  
- `good first issue` → for beginners; provide context, suggested solutions, and helpful resources.  
- `help wanted` → for contributors who need less guidance.  
- `beginner` → for those gaining confidence.  

#### Documentation

As your project evolves, documentation must stay up to date to reflect its current state. Create issues for documentation improvements, or encourage community members to write tutorials and how-to guides.

#### Community Contributions

As your community grows, managing engagement becomes challenging. Community members can help by facilitating discussions, answering questions, and sharing knowledge in forums and chat apps. This strengthens collaboration and mutual support.

#### Advocacy and Outreach

Some contributors excel in writing or public speaking. Encourage them to create blog posts, educational content, or conference talks about your project. Sharing updates on social media is another valuable way to contribute.  
At OpenSauced, for example, we encourage members to write under our [organization on Dev.to](https://dev.to/opensauced).

#### Managing Issues

Issue management includes identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing bug reports and feature requests. Forming a triage team helps streamline this process. Provide contributors with clear guidance, such as the [Triage Guide](https://opensauced.pizza/docs/contributing/triage-guide/) at OpenSauced.  
For more, read [this article](https://dev.to/opensauced/collaborate-conquer-grow-mastering-the-art-of-issue-management-for-open-source-projects-49gi).

#### Community Events and Hackathons

Events are powerful ways to strengthen collaboration. At OpenSauced, we run the [#100DaysOfOSS challenge](https://opensauced.pizza/docs/community/100-days-of-oss/) to encourage contributors of all backgrounds.  

You can survey your community to identify event interests, then form a team to organize them. Allowing members to take ownership increases belonging and engagement.

## Fostering New Talent

After creating opportunities, track which contributors consistently return and deliver quality work. These individuals may become core community members, ensuring continuity as maintainers move on. Core members can onboard newcomers, share expertise, and sustain long-term growth.

To foster talent, provide mentorship, constructive feedback, and leadership opportunities. Investing in contributors helps build a sustainable community that supports your project’s success.

### Identify New Talent with OpenSauced

## Conclusion

Open source is a journey of learning, growth, and opportunity. Building and nurturing a welcoming, supportive community is essential for long-term success.

A positive culture that encourages diverse contributions and fosters new talent attracts and retains people, drives innovation, and boosts productivity. By creating a space where contributors feel valued, respected, and empowered, you unlock their full potential.

However, building such a culture is not a one-time task. It requires continuous effort, investment in diversity and inclusion, and a commitment to collaboration. Doing so creates a foundation of trust and respect that allows both your community and projects to thrive.  

In short, building and nurturing a welcoming and supportive community is not only the right thing to do—it’s also one of the most effective strategies for ensuring your project’s success.
